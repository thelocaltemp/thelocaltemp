**I'm TheLocalTemp!** I like late night web development, video games, and making unnecessary changes to personalization settings. I love Microsoft Windows (if you haven't guessed by the name already) and the Vue.js framework.

It's a common misconception that I'm named after %appdata% (C:/Users/Admin/AppData/Roaming). I am named after C:/Users/Admin/AppData/Local/Temp, which is a directory that stores temporary files.
