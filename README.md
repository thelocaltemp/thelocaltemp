## Hey there!

My name is TheLocalTemp! I am a software engineer from Europe specializing in:

- Flask (python web framework)
- Supabase and PostgreSQL in general
- Currently learning Vue.js

Productivity, organization, and meditation are things I find the most important for doing my best work and achieving the most I can. I am all for free software and open-source, and always try to push the limit of a certain technology or innovation or something!
